A chatbot is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, although as of 2019, chatbots are far short of being able to pass the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler ones scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.

## How do chatbots work?

Chatbots work by using a set of predetermined rules to determine what response to give to a user's input. For example, a chatbot might be programmed to understand that if a user inputs the phrase "I'm hungry," the chatbot should respond with a list of nearby restaurants.

## What are some benefits of chatbots?

Chatbots can be used to automate tasks that would otherwise be difficult or time-consuming. For example, a chatbot could be used to make appointment reminders or to automatically answer frequently asked questions. Additionally, chatbots can be used to help users find information more quickly, such as by providing search results or directions.
